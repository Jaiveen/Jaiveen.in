        <p style="text-align: left;font-size: 20px;">Time and place of birth
            Aryabhata mentions in the Aryabhatiya that he was 23 years old 3,600 years into the Kali Yuga, but 
            this is not to mean that the text was composed at that time. This mentioned year corresponds to 499 
            CE, and implies that he was born in 476.Aryabhata called himself a native of Kusumapura or 
            Pataliputra (present day Patna, Bihar).
            Mathematics
            Place value system and zero
            The place-value system, first seen in the 3rd-century Bakhshali Manuscript, was clearly in place in
             his work. While he did not use a symbol for zero, the French mathematician Georges Ifrah argues
            that knowledge of zero was implicit in Aryabhata's place-value system as a place holder for the 
            powers of ten with null coefficients.
            
            However, Aryabhata did not use the Brahmi numerals. Continuing the Sanskritic tradition from Vedic 
            times, he used letters of the alphabet to denote numbers, expressing quantities, such as the table
             of sines in a mnemonic form.[17]

             <h4 style="text-align:center;color:darkgreen;font-size:40px"><b>Srinivasa Ramanujan<img src=https://im.hunt.in/cg/iol//about/personalities/scientists/srinivasa-ramanujan/sri1.jpg style = float:left;width:300px;height:150px></b></h4>
             <p style="text-align:left;font-size:20px">Ramanujan was born on 22 December 1887
                 into a Tamil Brahmin Iyengar family in Erode, in present-day Tamil Nadu.[13] His father, Kuppuswamy Srinivasa Iyengar, 
                 originally from Thanjavur district, worked as a clerk in a sari shop.[14][2] His mother, Komalatammal, was a housewife 
                 and sang at a local temple.</p>
                 <p style="font-size: 20px">In 1910, Ramanujan met deputy collector V. Ramaswamy Aiyer, who founded the Indian Mathematical Society.[52] Wishing for a job at the revenue department where Aiyer worked, Ramanujan showed him his mathematics notebooks. As Aiyer later recalled:

                    I was struck by the extraordinary mathematical results contained in [the notebooks]. I had no mind to smother his genius by an appointment in the lowest rungs of the revenue department.[53]
                    
                    Aiyer sent Ramanujan, with letters of introduction, to his mathematician friends in Madras.[52] Some of them looked at his work and
                     gave him letters of introduction to R. Ramachandra Rao, the district collector for Nellore and the secretary of the Indian 
                     Mathematical Society.[54][55][56] Rao was impressed by Ramanujan's research but doubted that it was his own work. 
                     Ramanujan mentioned a correspondence he had with Professor Saldhana, a notable Bombay mathematician, in which Saldhana 
                     expressed a lack of understanding of his work but concluded that he was not a fraud.[57] Ramanujan's friend C. V.
                      Rajagopalachari tried to quell Rao's doubts about Ramanujan's academic integrity. Rao agreed to give him another chance,
                       and listened as Ramanujan discussed elliptic integrals, hypergeometric series, and his theory of divergent series,
                        which Rao said ultimately convinced him of Ramanujan's brilliance.[57] When Rao asked him what he wanted, Ramanujan
                         replied that he needed work and financial support. Rao consented and sent him to Madras. He continued his research
                          with Rao's financial aid. With Aiyer's help, Ramanujan had his work published in the Journal of the Indian
                           Mathematical Society</p>
                           <h5 style="text-align:center;color:darkgreen;font-size:40px"><b>Bhaskara</b></h5>
                           <p style="text-align:right;font-size: 20px;"><img src=https://www.booksfact.com/images/science/ancient_science/bhaskaracharya.jpg style = vertical-align:middle;width:300px;height:150px>
                            This reveals that he was born in 1036 of the Shaka era (1114 CE), and that he composed the Siddhānta Shiromani when he was 36 years old.[14] Siddhānta Shiromani was completed during 1150 CE. He also wrote another work called the Karaṇa-kutūhala when he was 69 (in 1183).[14] His works show the influence of Brahmagupta, Śrīdhara, Mahāvīra, Padmanābha and other predecessors.[14] Bhaskara lived in Patnadevi located near Patan (Chalisgaon) in the vicinity of Sahyadri.[15]
                              He was born in a Deśastha Rigvedi Brahmin family[16] near Vijjadavida (Vijjalavida). Munishvara (17th century), a commentator on Siddhānta Shiromani of Bhaskara has given the information about the location of Vijjadavida in his work Marīci Tīkā as follows:</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px"> of Bhaskara's contributions to mathematics include the following:

                                A proof of the Pythagorean theorem by calculating the same area in two different ways and then cancelling out terms to get a2 + b2 = c2.[21]
                                In Lilavati, solutions of quadratic, cubic and quartic indeterminate equations are explained.[22]
                                Solutions of indeterminate quadratic equations (of the type ax2 + b = y2).
                                Integer solutions of linear and quadratic indeterminate equations (Kuṭṭaka). The rules he gives are (in effect) the same as those given by the Renaissance European mathematicians of the 17th century.
                                A cyclic Chakravala method for solving indeterminate equations of the form ax2 + bx + c = y. The solution to this equation was traditionally attributed to William Brouncker in 1657, though his method was more difficult than the chakravala method.
                                The first general method for finding the solutions of the problem x2 − ny2 = 1 (so-called "Pell's equation") was given by Bhaskara II.[23]
                                Solutions of Diophantine equations of the second order, such as 61x2 + 1 = y2. This very equation was posed as a problem in 1657 by the French mathematician Pierre de Fermat, but its solution was unknown in Europe until the time of Euler in the 18th century.[22]</p>
